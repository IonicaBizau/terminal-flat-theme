## Installation

### Using `npm`

```sh
# This is currently compatible with Gnome Terminal only
$ npm i terminal-flat-theme
```

### Cloning the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/IonicaBizau/terminal-flat-theme.git terminal-flat-theme
$ cd terminal-flat-theme
# The install script is currently compatible with Gnome Terminal only
$ ./install.sh
```


To switch back to the original scheme just switch the profile in the terminal preferences, since the script above will just create a new profile.

Currently this repository contains the scheme for Gnome Terminal (default terminal in Ubuntu) and Terminal.app. However, you can use [this link](http://terminal.sexy/#FyY0-vr6V2x_7mJUUNqL_blNY7Hlx4HlU97DuLu7eY6j_HtuZfai_dhAYrz51J3rV-3P2-Dg) to export this theme for your terminal.

After running the script above, you have to select the new profile.

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects
I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:


 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
